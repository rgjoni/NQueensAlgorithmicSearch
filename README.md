# NQueensPuzzle
Wrote a class that demonstrates how the HillClimbing Algorithm is used to solve the N by N queens problem
To run simply type 'make' in the terminal
To change the dimensions of the board in the make file on line 8 simply change the first two numbers
So  line 8 currently reads './$(EXEC) 8 8'
If you wanted a 4 by 4 board it would be './$(EXEC) 4 4'
